    - Once you have finished the development of the project, you should record a video presenting the features of the project you built. It is a video with a maximum length of 5 minutes. The content of the video should include:

        - a description of the project.
        - a demo of the project features.
        - you should also highlight some interesting piece of code or something you built that you are very proud of.
- For recording the video you can use tools like Loom that let you share a private link to the recording, and configure a shot that shows your computer screen and your face at the same time in a small picture.
